# Scaleway Container Authentication PSR-15 Middleware

> Deprecation notice : Scaleway Container Authentication has been deprecated because the authorization process is built-in now.

Private Scaleway Containers allows you to restrict access to them which prevents unauthorized access. Contrary to private functions where the authorization process is built-in, it needs to be configured inside the container. (see https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/containers/api-cli/restricting-access-to-a-container)

This PSR15 Middleware provide runtime token validation to manage authentication access to the Scaleway Container.
